# DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT :
This project demonstrates a Python-based text summarization tool using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The tool accepts lengthy articles or textual content as input and generates a concise summary by identifying and retaining the most relevant sentences.

Libraries Used in the Project:
1. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):
A comprehensive library for natural language processing tasks.

2.collections.Counter:
A Python standard library for counting the occurrences of elements in a collection.
Used to compute word frequencies.

3.heapq:
A Python standard library for working with heaps (priority queues).
Used to efficiently retrieve the highest-scoring sentences for the summary.

Key Features:
1.Tokenization: Breaks the text into sentences and words.
2.Stopword Removal: Removes common, insignificant words (e.g., "and," "the") to focus on meaningful terms.
3.Word Frequency Analysis: Assigns importance to words based on their frequency in the text.
4.Sentence Scoring: Scores sentences based on the cumulative importance of words they contain.
5.Summary Extraction: Selects top-scoring sentences to generate the summary, ensuring brevity while retaining context.
